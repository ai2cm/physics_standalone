This Readme-file contains information on the use of the files realted to the GT4Py implementation of the sea ice parameterization.
For information on the use of other files please have a look at the main Readme file.

----------------------------------------

PYTHON
main.py
Runs and validates the sea ice parameterization in plain python.

sea_ice.py
Sea ice parameterization in plain python.

sea_ice_timer.py
Sea ice parameterization in plain python with a timer to measure performance.

----------------------------------------

GT4PY
main_gt4py.py
Runs and validates the sea ice parameterization in GT4Py.

sea_ice_gt4py.py
GT4Py implementation of the sea ice parameterization. This file contains one single stencil.

sea_ice_gt4py_3sten.py
GT4Py implementation of the sea ice parameterization.
This file contains three individual stencils, because a workaround for the backend gtcuda had to be applied such that it compiled.

----------------------------------------

main_performance.py
Runs performance tests with plain python and different GT4Py backends and plots the results.

sea_ice_getpoints.py
Writes land/sea point and sea-ice points to file to compute a mask.
Attention, this is a dirty file. The file has to be adapted, such that both points are saved.
The file raises an error, when the first point is saved to file.

obj
This repository contains a land/sea point and a sea-ice point, which were used to initialize the arrays for the performance tests.

ice.dat
land.dat
These are the sea ice and land points, respectivley. They are needed to initialize the arrays for the performance tests. 

----------------------------------------

PLOTTING        
plot_fortran.py
boxplot_fortran.py
boxplot_python.py
These are the plotting scripts to generate the plots shown in the report. 

----------------------------------------

main_performance_cpu_time.F
Runs performance tests of the fortran implementation of the sea ice parameterisation using the cpu_time command.

main_performance_system_clock.F
Runs performance tests of the fortran implementation of the sea ice parameterisation using the system_clock command.

----------------------------------------

results_non_optimized.dat
results_optimized.dat
These are the performance data from the Fortran runs with optimized compiler options and no compiler options.
